## Overview

Web Dōjō is a learning and testing environment
for web application hacking and pentesting.

The lab includes a collection of [vulnerable applications](#available-applications)
easy accessible by a [landing page](#the-dojo).

## Available Applications

- [Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA)](http://dvwa.co.uk/)
- [OWASP JuiceShop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
- [WebGoat 8.0](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat)

## Getting Started

The lab can be deployed either with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) on its own VM
or on any machine running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Clone and browse the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xffsec/webdojo.git
cd webdojo
```

#### Using Vagrant (preferred)

Requirements: [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

```sh
vagrant up
```

:martial_arts_uniform: Done!\
The dojo will be available at http://10.0.0.3

#### Using Docker Compose

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

:martial_arts_uniform: Done!\
The dojo will be available at http://127.0.0.1

## The Dojo

The dojo is a single page application (SPA)
that serves as a menu for the available apps.

## VirtualBox Network

When using Vagrant,
the installation creates a [Host-Only Network](https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/user/network_hostonly.html) with address `10.0.0.1/24`
and DHCP disabled.
The VM is attached to the network with the static IP `10.0.0.3`.

```sh
$ vboxmanage list hostonlyifs

Name:            vboxnet3
GUID:            786f6276-656e-4474-8000-0a0027000004
DHCP:            Disabled
IPAddress:       10.0.0.1
NetworkMask:     255.255.255.0
…
```

If your pentesting machine lives in a different VM,
add a new adaptor to it and attach it to the newly created network.

**The IP has to be manually set inside the VM.**

## Other Considerations

#### Why Docker Compose

Containers were initially built and started
by iterating through a YAML file.
Docker Compose
removes complexity from the provisioner
while adding flexibility to the deployment.
This modularization allows not only to deploy on a VM
but on any system running Docker.
